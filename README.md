# Flight-Tracker-Project

Extracted flight data from 26 airports around the world using the requests library in Python and the Opensky API, employing Pandas to convert the resulting JSON file to a dataframe for ease of analysis. 

Queried the data frame based on airport names and grouped the dataset by day to obtain a count of the number of departing aircraft per day at each airport using Pandas.
